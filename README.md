# PDF & Image Summarizer â€” React + Express + Material UI (OCR + PDF Parsing)

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Drag & drop upload (**PDF**, **PNG/JPG/WebP**)
- âœ… **PDF text extraction** (keeps line breaks) using `pdf-parse`
- âœ… **OCR** for images & scanned/imageâ€‘PDFs using `tesseract.js` + Popplerâ€™s `pdftoppm`
- âœ… **Summary length toggle**: **SHORT | MEDIUM | LONG**
- âœ… **Copy** button in the **topâ€‘right** of the summary box
- âœ… **Dark/Light** theme (persists)
- âœ… **CORS** for global hosting (restrict by domain via env var)

## ðŸ§© Problem-Solving Approach

The project addresses the challenge of extracting and summarizing content from both **text-based PDFs** and **scanned/image-based documents**. The solution follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Input Handling**  
   Users upload PDFs or images via a React frontend with Material UI, using a drag-and-drop interface for convenience and validation.

2. **Text Extraction**  
   - For **text-based PDFs**, the server uses `pdf-parse` to quickly extract text.  
   - If the PDF lacks embedded text (scanned files), **Poppler (`pdftoppm`)** converts each page into PNG images, which are then processed by **Tesseract.js** for OCR.  
   - Direct image uploads (JPG/PNG) are OCRâ€™d with Tesseract.js.

3. **Summarization**  
   Extracted text is split into sentences using `natural`. After removing common stopwords (`stopword`), word frequencies are calculated. Sentences are scored and the top ones are selected based on the chosen length (**SHORT | MEDIUM | LONG**).

4. **Output & Interaction**  
   The React frontend presents the summary in a clean Material UI card with a **copy button** for reuse. Users can adjust summary length and toggle between light/dark themes for a polished experience.

## ðŸ§© Libraries Used (Beginnerâ€‘Friendly)

### Frontend
- **React** / **ReactDOM** â€” UI framework and DOM renderer.
- **Material UI (`@mui/material`)** â€” polished, accessible components (Buttons, Paper, AppBar, etc.).
- **MUI Icons (`@mui/icons-material`)** â€” icons like copy, upload, sun/moon.
- **Emotion (`@emotion/*`)** â€” styling engine MUI uses for theming.
- **react-dropzone** â€” drag & drop file uploads with acceptance & drag states.
- **axios** â€” promiseâ€‘based HTTP client.
- **Vite** â€” dev server & build tool. Reads `VITE_*` env vars at build time.

### Backend
- **Express** â€” minimal web framework for routes (`/api/extract`, `/api/summarize`).  
- **cors** â€” enables **Crossâ€‘Origin** requests (frontend â†” backend across domains).
- **multer** â€” handles `multipart/form-data` uploads (the file itself).
- **pdf-parse** â€” extracts **real text** from **textâ€‘based PDFs** quickly.
- **tesseract.js** â€” **OCR** for images & scanned PDFs (turns pixels into text).
- **stopword** â€” removes common words before scoring sentences.
- **natural** â€” sentence tokenizer and NLP utilities.
- **(System)** **Poppler** (`pdftoppm`) â€” converts PDF pages to PNG for OCR.
